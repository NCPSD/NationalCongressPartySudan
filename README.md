        <h2>About National Congress Party of Sudan</h2>
        <p>
            The National Congress Party (NCP) is a political party in Sudan. It was founded in 1998 by a merger of several political groups and individuals. The party played a significant role in Sudanese politics for many years.

            The NCP was the ruling party in Sudan from 1989 until 2019 when a series of protests and civil unrest led to the ousting of former President Omar al-Bashir, who had been in power for three decades.

            The party's political ideology is based on Islamism and Arab nationalism. It advocates for Islamic law (Sharia) and seeks to promote Arab identity and culture in Sudan.
